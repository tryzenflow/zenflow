## 0.1.0-beta.1

### Minor Changes

- bc5e9b6: Notes now store file ids and the API signs file URLs at read time; mobile resolves origin-relative file
  refs in notes. Backend moves notifications and ingestion onto BullMQ queues with a runtime kill switch,
  partitions `SessionEvent` monthly, re-cuts the six placement arms, serves the API behind nginx on port 8000
  and disables Swagger in production.

## 0.1.0-beta.0

### Minor Changes

- b0d6516: First beta. Mobile now has a test pyramid (unit, component tests with MSW, Maestro e2e smoke flows)
  with testIDs on key screens, plus CI that builds an Android APK and an iOS simulator app. The whole
  repo moves to a single beta version line managed by changesets.
